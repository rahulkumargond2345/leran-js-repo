This repository is a collection of my learning journey as I explore JavaScript from the ground up. I am focusing on building a strong foundation before moving on to advanced concepts and projects.

Topics I've Completed:

JavaScript Data Types (String, Number, Boolean, etc.)

Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical)

Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)

Loops (for, while, do...while)

Why I'm Learning JavaScript:
JavaScript is the core language of the web. Learning it thoroughly is important for both frontend (like React, Vue) and backend (like Node.js) development. I'm aiming to master the fundamentals before diving into real-world applications.

What's Next:

Functions (regular and arrow functions)

Arrays and objects

DOM Manipulation

Events and ES6+ features
